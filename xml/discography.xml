                The band debuted on the 23rd of August 2019 with their single “wave.” They were under POCLANOS when they released the single. Wave to Earth only had 2 members at the time, Kim Daniel and Shin Donggyu. In the record, Kim Daniel played most of the instruments except the drums. Wave is a light-hearted and cheerful track, with dreamy guitars and simple soft hitting drums. The lyrics tell us about being remembered in a wave which aligns with the band’s intention of creating a new wave in the music world.

                The song “Surf”, released in 2023, tells how someone can enjoy time with the person they love. For them, life feels very sweet when he is with that person. It is not wrong to allocate time and enjoy completely freely. This song is perfect when we are on a vacation event, especially when we are near the ocean. As the song title suggests, “Surf” invites listeners to surf more freely than ever before.

                Pueblo is a small village. Wave to Earth wraps every lyric in a beautiful song. It's a song where someone has a dream to go to the moon. We all have our own “moon”. There may be many struggles and conflicts, even emptiness when things feel difficult. Let's reflect on our journey for a moment by listening to this song.

                "Daisy" could be a metaphor for innocence, hope, and happiness. Released on May 13, 2021, this song is about finding hope and joy in life that feels monochrome like and old TV. They make us feel what it's like to wait for the "daisy" to bloom and bring color to our days.

                The phrase "Nouvelle Vague" means "new wave" in French. Released on November 24, 2021, this song talks about how we struggle in life, but also have a desire to find something to see in the future. Even though the future feels so far away from us, at least we still have the strength to keep going.

                "Calla" could refer to the calla lily flower which loves full sun and symbolizes beauty and renewal. Released on June 8, 2022, this song is about the willingness to face life's challenges with someone we love. It's also about how we will help "calla" to reach the sunlight, making sure they can grow back.

                As the title suggests, Wave to Earth treats the protagonist like a dried flower. He feels that his relationship with the person he loves is lifeless. There is nothing to rely on to rebuild the lost love.

                Wave 0.01 - Their first EP was released on the 2nd of January 2020, with John Cha (their now third official member) joining in late 2019 also contributing to this album, the 3 of them poured their hard work to the release.
                The first track, Gold, showcased their ability of creating complicated melodies and patterns influenced by jazz styles of playing, the lyrics talks about how people want to live a “golden” life, but the writer thought of how in the end gold is just gold that would all perish, and he would want to instead focus on the real gold which is the moment he is now living.
                The next track, Bonfire, depicts the condition of a fading passion or love. Where one's world becomes so dark that even a firefly appears like a star. Daniel also included the feeling of a person not knowing their emotion or possibly their love interest’s. The depressive lyrics accompanied with mellow instrumentations creates the perfect track to overthink or cry to.
                Then it follows by previously released tracks, wave and light. You can also see our review of them in the discography.
                The track Bird, shows the writer's thoughts upon a bird. How it feels for a bird to fly, do they look down or forward, are the questions asked in the song. It tells the feeling of fascination upon how freely a bird could live, how it could fly to wherever it wants to. Probably, how the author wants to live freely like a bird.
                The last purple lake is an r&amp;b and back to their jazz inspired sound. Complex drum shuffles and neo-soul like chord progression is the nuance of the track. The song tells how someone wants to swim in someone else's (probably a love interest) dream, meaning how they want to know what the person is like or what they are thinking about, without “waking them up”.

                Summer flows 0.02 - They released a summer themed EP on August 2020, capturing the essence of summer through the songs in the EP. There are songs with groovy instrumental and fun lyrics, and there are also mellow songs and one talking about a failed love story because how their life is not kept up. What a way to spend summer isn’t it?

                Flaws and all 0.1 - in their first album, they wanted to show how in even the flaws of each song you can still find beauty in it. The album has 2 discs, disc A is their more refined, cleanly produced side of the album; it tells stories about falling in love and appreciating love. While disc 2 is the more warm sounding, less produced side. Call it the “flaws side” if you will, this disc has a lot of showcasing wave to earth’s musicality. Not only that you also get a mellow track to bawl your eyes out to. (full in-depth review of all the tracks coming soon)
